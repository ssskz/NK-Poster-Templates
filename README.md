# NK-Poster-Templates
This is a academic poster written by LaTeX.

First of all, Thanks to the original author of the UQ Poster Template, without his work, I cannot finish this template so fast.

For the users, I didnot upload the figures'directory, so you should make your own directory of figures, by the way, donot forget to make sure the path.

Please compile the codes by LuaTex. But I suggest you to compile the codes on Overleaf.



# The structure of the codes

PosterTemplate.tex: This is the main file, so if you want to change the content of the poster, please change this file.

poster.bib: This is the file for BibLatex.

beamercolorthemeuchicago.sty: This is the file that define the color of the poster.

beamerthemegemini.sty: This is the file that define the environment of the poster.
